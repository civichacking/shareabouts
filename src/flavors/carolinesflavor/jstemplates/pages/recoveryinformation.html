<p class="p3">What is recovery planning and what does it have to do with resiliency?</p>
<p class="p4">Recovery planning aims to be a participatory process designed to restore the physical structures of a community affected by a disaster to pre-disaster condition. With growing acceptance of the new realities that are brought by climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, recovery planners are moving towards building-back more resilient, not to pre-disaster conditions that proved too vulnerable. Recovery planning is a long-term process, and part of recovery is providing a continuum of care to meet the diverse needs of residents who's lives were changed by the disaster. Communities need assistance in the form of financial resources, psychological and emotional support, technical training in building more resilient communities, guidance on next steps for building-back or moving-out, and the list goes on…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Recovery planning should position a community to be ready for the future by building on existing community assets, and reducing the risk of vulnerabilities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Who is working in recovery and resiliency in the community?</p>
<p class="p4">Each community has individuals and organizations that focus on recovery in that locality. If they don't, the Recovery Needs Shareabouts is a useful tool to identify areas in need of more assistance. It is important to have locals working in recovery, and not to depend on government such as FEMA or the State agencies, because local knowledge is key to any planning process.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">A few local organizations working in recovery and resiliency building include:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Portside NY</li>
  <li class="li4">Metropolitan Waterfront Alliance</li>
  <li class="li4">Sustainable Long Island</li>
  <li class="li4">New York City Environmental Justice Alliance</li>
  <li class="li4">Far Rockaway Waterfront Alliance</li>
  <li class="li4">Far Rockaway Artist Alliance</li>
</ul>
<p class="p4">...</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">What government agencies are working in recovery and resiliency?<span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4">Government agencies are best positioned to provide a number of services in the recovery process, they include but are not limited to:</p>
<p class="p4">coordination of resources and initiatives at government and nongovernment agencies</p>
<p class="p4">technical training and subject experts that can be deployed in community workshops</p>
<p class="p4">numerous grant opportunities for everything from small businesses to wetland restoration</p>
<p class="p4">creation and alteration of regulatory laws that can support or undermine recovery efforts</p>
<p class="p4">At FEMA, the National Disaster Recovery Framework has brought federal agencies working on recovery under the same roof. These agencies include the Department of Interior, the EPA, NOAA, HUD, the Department of Commerce, and many other agencies that can provide unique resources to the recovery process.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p4">The Recovery Needs Shareabouts map has allowed for the grouping of each input under a topic. These topics will help direct issues to the appropriate government or nongovernment agency that focuses on that topic.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
