<p class="p3">Hello! You're looking at a demo of the Recovery Needs Shareabouts, a mapping project hosted by <a href="http://openplans.org/civicworks"><span class="s1">OpenPlans</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p4">***</p>
<p class="p3">The Recovery Needs Shareabouts was developed with the goal of serving the community by creating a new innovative way for residents to contribute to recovery and resiliency planning and building.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Planning agencies and consultant groups are required to facilitate community participation by holding visioning meetings and workshops, however these outreach efforts fail to get the critical mass of community members, necessary for meaningful community participation, to come out and contribute. In providing this publicly accessible website, a greater mass of individuals and organizations have the opportunity to have their voice heard, and through the visually appealing and easy to read map format; important issues can be brought to the attention of those who can address them.</p>
<p class="p4">***</p>
<p class="p3">Shareabouts is a simple web app for crowdsourced mapping. You can use it to collect public input on maps - for example, where should a new park be built? Which bus stops need a new shelter? People can put dots on the map, add comments, discuss other people's suggestions and share locations over social networks. Read more about Shareabouts at <a href="http://shareabouts.org/"><span class="s1">shareabouts.org</span></a>, or head to <a href="https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts/"><span class="s1">Shareabouts on github</span></a>. The project is <a href="https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts/"><span class="s1">open source</span></a>, and we welcome your involvement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p3">Thanks for trying out Shareabouts and contributing to the Recovery Needs map!</p>
